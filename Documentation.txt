First, I've changed tailwind.config.ts file to have custom colors and values
then created a folder constants where there is a file index.ts which is used for navigation bar, and demo user for helping frontend creation.
Then Created types folder and inside index.d.ts declared all the types
changed public folder and added .svg icons.
There is one more folder named lib which has utils.ts file, it has all the helper functions.
inside app folder, i've changed globals.css for some custom CSS.
and layout.tsx folder, i've changed inter variable in which i've added one more field name: variable and gave value of '--font-inter'

FOLDER STRUCTURE.
inside app folder, 
    Create group folder(So it will not get included inside next.js route)
    - /app/(root)/page.tsx and layout.tsx
    We'll have sidebar inside that layout.tsx file.
    - Now create another group route named (auth)
    - /app/(auth)/layout.tsx, which will not have sidebar

After creating sign-in and sign-up form, we'll have to create an API which will handle the form using appwrite
We are using the concept like server actions.
    - It is the concept known as Server actions and Mutations.
        - Server Actions are asynchronous functions that are executed on the server. They can be used in Server and Client components to handle form submissions and data mutations in Next.js applications.
        
for that create a folder inside lib directive /lib/actions/user.actions.ts
in appwrite we use actions to do so the signin and the functionalities, so all the code related to appwrite is in lib directory.
